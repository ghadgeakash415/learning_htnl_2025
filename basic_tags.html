    <pre>At a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.[8] It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya states that it is so called because "the crop of liberation" grows here.[9]

A folk legend about Kedarnath relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas wanted to atone for the sins committed during the Kurukshetra war.                        Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of the Shiva and to seek his blessings. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them and assumed the form of a bull (Nandi). Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then saw the bull grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" â€” the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva).                Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. These five places are collectively known as Panch Kedar.[1][10][11]</pre>
